        <h1 class="intro__title">Nizar Qabbani's career</h1>

        <p class="intro__description">
            At the age of fifteen, Nizar Qabbani’s sister died due to contested reasons.
            When asked whether he was a revolutionary, the poet answered: “Love in the Arab world is like a prisoner, 
            and I want to set (it) free. I want to free the Arab soul, sense, and body with my poetry. 
            The relationships between men and women in our society are not healthy.” 
            He is known as one of the most feminist and progressive intellectuals of his time.
        </p>
        <p class="intro__description">
            In 1981, Nizar Qabbani’s wife, Balqees, died in a bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, 
            during the Lebanese civil war. The death of Balqees profoundly affected Qabbani’s psychology and poetry.
            He expressed his grief in an exceptionally moving poem titled Balqees. 
            Qabbani blamed all Arab regimes for her death. Additionally, 
            Qabbani used the death of his beloved Balqees to symbolize the death of Arab people in the Levant by their governments.
            "Balqees: I ask forgiveness. Maybe your life was for mine, a sacrifice. 
            I know well that your killers’ aims were to kill my words. My beautiful, rest in peace. 
            After you, poetry will cease and womanhood is out of place. Generations of children flocks Will keep asking about your long hair locks. 
            Generations of lovers will read about you, the true instructor. 
            One day the Arabs will get it that they killed the prophetess and the prophets."
        </p>
        <p class="intro__description">
            The city of Damascus remained the most powerful muse in his poetry, most notably in the Jasmine Scent of Damascus.
            However, Qabbani expressed his love for all Arab citizens and cities 
            from Mauritania extending to Iraq as one people connected by the same struggle and a rich past. 
            In the second stanza of Umm al-Mu'tazz he said: 
            "Every Arab city is my mother, Damascus, Beirut, Cairo, Baghdad, Khartoum, Casablanca, Benghazi, 
            Tunis, Amman, Riyadh, Kuwait, Algiers, Abu Dhabi, and their sisters: These are my family tree. 
            All of these cities brought me forth from their wombs, cave me to suck from their breasts. 
            And filled my pockets with grapes, figs and plums. All of them shook their date palms for me so that I could eat. 
            Opened their skies for me like a blue notebook so that I could write. For this reason, I do not enter an Arab city without it calling me, 
            "My son." I do not knock on the gate of an Arab city without finding my childhood bed waiting for me. 
            No Arab city bleeds without my bleeding with it."
        </p>
